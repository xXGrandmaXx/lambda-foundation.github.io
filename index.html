      <h1>About us 🧑‍💻</h1>
      <hr />

      <p>We are a club of coding buddies that were bored and created Lambda Foundation.</p>

      <pWe are here to help people overcome their "SYNTAX ERRORS" 😂.</p>

      <p>Lambda foundation is a coding group created by a pack of coding buddies. We saw that most of our friends struggle when trying to get into the world of code. We decided to create this group to kickstart people's development in programming.</p>

      <p>Before we could work on projects as a group, we had to teach our friends how to use the following tools:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>GitHub</li>
        <li>Python3</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Our motto for coding:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>
          We help you start the game. THE GAME OF CODE!
          <br />
          Don't be afraid to try coding, be excited!
	        <br />
	        Whatever you do, don't give up!
